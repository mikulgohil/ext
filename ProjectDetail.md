   - The file will be opened in the editor for immediate editing

### Advanced Usage

1. **Customizing component location**
   - By default, the extension will try to detect common Next.js component directories
   - If no suitable directory is found, you'll be prompted to select one
   - Components are created in their own directory with an index.tsx file

2. **Iterative refinement**
   - If the generated component doesn't meet your requirements, you can:
     - Modify your description to be more specific
     - Provide a different reference image
     - Edit the generated code manually

3. **Working with existing projects**
   - The extension works best with existing Next.js projects
   - It will detect your project structure and place components accordingly
   - For non-Next.js projects, you may need to manually specify the component location

### Troubleshooting

1. **API Key Issues**
   - If you encounter authentication errors, verify your API key is correct
   - Ensure your Anthropic account has access to the Claude model
   - Check your billing status on the Anthropic platform

2. **Generation Failures**
   - If component generation fails, try simplifying your description
   - Break complex components into smaller, more manageable parts
   - Check your internet connection

3. **File Creation Issues**
   - If automatic file creation fails, check your project permissions
   - Ensure VS Code has write access to your project directories
   - Try manually saving the generated code to your desired location

4. **Build and Package Issues**
   - If you encounter `webpack: command not found` when running npm scripts, use npx:
     ```bash
     npx webpack --mode production
     ```
   - Alternatively, make sure all dependencies are properly installed:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - For other build issues, try cleaning node_modules and reinstalling:
     ```bash
     rm -rf node_modules
     npm install
     ```
   - If you see "SVGs can't be used as icons" error when packaging:
     1. Convert your SVG icon to PNG format (128x128px recommended)
     2. Update the package.json to reference the PNG file:
        ```json
        "icon": "icon.png"
        ```
     3. Run the package command again
     
   - If you encounter "Extension entrypoint(s) missing" error:
     1. Check your .vscodeignore file to ensure it's not ignoring your build output:
        ```
        # Remove or comment out this line
        # dist/**
        ```
     2. Make sure the "main" field in package.json points to the correct location:
        ```json
        "main": "./dist/extension.js",
        ```
     3. Run the build and package commands again
     
   - If you see "The model is not supported" error:
     1. Update the model in extension.js to use the current model:
        ```javascript
        const response = await anthropic.messages.create({
            model: 'claude-3-opus-20240229',  // Use the latest available Claude model
            system: systemPrompt,
            messages: messages,
            max_tokens: 4096,
            temperature: 0.7
        });
        ```
     2. Rebuild the extension
